# HumanRiskSim

**Human Error Cyber Attack Simulator** – Python-based educational and professional dashboard for cybersecurity awareness.

## Problem Statement

Human error is one of the leading causes of cybersecurity incidents. Actions such as clicking on phishing emails, using weak passwords, connecting to public Wi-Fi, or ignoring software updates can compromise sensitive data and systems. Many organizations fail to adequately train users or simulate these risks, leading to repeated breaches and data loss.

**HumanRiskSim** aims to educate users and organizations about the risks of human error by simulating common cyber attack scenarios and showing their potential impact.

## Why Human Error Matters

- Human mistakes account for a large portion of cyber breaches.  
- Employees often unintentionally expose sensitive data.  
- Simulating human error helps users understand the consequences and encourages safer behavior.  
- Organizations can use these simulations to improve security awareness training.

## How the Simulator Works

1. **Select a scenario**: Phishing emails, weak passwords, public Wi-Fi login, or ignoring software updates.  
2. **Run the simulation**: The system calculates a **risk score** (numeric) and assigns a **risk level** (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).  
3. **View results**:
   - **Impact** of the human error  
   - **Prevention tips** to reduce risk  
   - **Real-world statistics** and examples for awareness  
4. **Professional dashboard**: Includes progress bars for risk, icons for impact/prevention, scrollable output, and color-coded panels for clarity.

**Data** for the simulation is stored in `scenarios.json`, making it easy to expand with new scenarios or update existing ones.
