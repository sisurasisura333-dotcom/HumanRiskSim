# HumanRiskSim – Human Error Cyber Attack Simulator

HumanRiskSim is a beginner-friendly cyber security simulation tool that demonstrates
how common human mistakes can lead to cyber security incidents.

## Purpose
Most cyber attacks occur due to human behavior rather than technical failures.
This project simulates those mistakes and explains the potential impact and prevention.

## Features
- Simulates real-world human security mistakes
- Calculates risk level (Low / Medium / High)
- Explains business impact and prevention steps
- Fully legal and educational

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Console-based simulation

## Future Improvements
- Multiple scenario selection
- Risk scoring customization
- GUI or web dashboard
- Organization-specific simulations

## Data Sources
This project uses publicly available cyber security reports such as:
- Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)
- ENISA Threat Landscape Reports

All data is used for educational and risk modeling purposes only.
